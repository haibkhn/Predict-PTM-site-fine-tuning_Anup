# Prediction of dephosphorylation sites using fine-tuned protein large models and integrate it as a Galaxy tool

Using fine-tuned transformer-based architecture (ProtTrans - short for Protein Transformer) to predict dephosphorylation sites and integrating it as a galaxy tool.

## Getting started

```bash
cd conda_requirements/
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate test_new
```

## Datasets

Datasets are in fasta format and can be found src/input_datasets. Original datasets can be found here https://github.com/dukkakc/DTLDephos/tree/main/dataset
